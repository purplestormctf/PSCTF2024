#### Why was there a `SUID` bit set on `gdb`? 

Well this was plan b. Also the exploitation didn't cause any damage to the system and is very reliable. At first I wanted to made a file readable, like `/etc/shadow` by using `relayd`. But the setup was kinda weird.

#### How can the CTF evolve?

I am thinking about sponsorships from companies who provider custom challenges they want to see to get solved and we connect them all within our CTF. Like a big CTF network over the Internet.

We also can make it public next time. Creating a registration and flag submission system and more custom challenges like binary exploitation, reversing or forensics for example.

This also means more organisational doings and way more work to coordinate this stuff.
